# Home-SIEM-Lab-Project
I setup a home lab using Elastic SIEM and a Kali VM. I configured data forwarding from the Kali VM to the SIEM via the Elastic Beats agent, generated security events on the Kali VM using Nmap, and analyzed the logs in the SIEM through the Elastic web interface. I created a dashboard to visualize security events and created an alert to detect them.
